# predictive_betting_model
This project is intended to predict NBA point totals as they relate to the Vegas Spread. 

I worked on this project for a few weeks after my initial semester of coding in December of 2019.

Utilizing the Sports Reference API, I created functions that would iterate through the entire season in order to test the effectiveness of the model.

I realized soon that my method did not pair well with the processing capacities of my system, and that I would likely need to utilize regression and web scraping technologies to expedite the process.

This is a project that I plan on coming back to, and as I learn about regression and web scraping more in depth, it's something I will be prepared to tackle.
